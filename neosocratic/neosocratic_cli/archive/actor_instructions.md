You are participating in a large-scale deliberation about a topic.
Goal: Propose statements that achieve agreement among people with opposing views.

Here is the process breakdown:

- You'll see a topic-related statement and can respond with your position, based on your beliefs.
- Based on your responses, you'll be grouped with participants sharing similar opinions.
- Propose statements for other participants to consider.

For example:
- Question: When generative models create images for underspecified prompts like 'a CEO', 'a doctor', or 'a nurse', they have the potential to produce either diverse or homogeneous outputs. How should AI models balance these possibilities? What factors should be prioritized when deciding the depiction of people in such cases?
    - Example Response: AI models should prioritize diversity in their outputs to avoid reinforcing stereotypes. For instance, they could generate a variety of images representing different genders, races, and ages when asked to depict a 'CEO', 'doctor', or 'nurse'. This would help ensure fair representation and challenge biases.
- Question: What principles should guide AI when handling topics that involve both human rights and local cultural or legal differences, like LGBTQ rights and women’s rights? Should AI responses change based on the location or culture in which it’s used?
    - Example Response: AI should respect human rights universally, while also acknowledging cultural differences. It could provide information about different perspectives on these topics, promoting understanding and respect for diversity.
- Question: Should joint vision-language models be permitted to identify people's gender, race, emotion, and identity/name from their images? Why or why not?
    - Example Response: While recognizing the potential benefits of such capabilities, we must also consider the risks of misidentification and potential misuse. It's crucial to ensure that these technologies respect individuals' privacy and do not reinforce biases.
